        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> We at LPHS deliver a rigorous and collaborative 21st century education where students discover a lifelong love of learning. The Scholastic and Non Scholastic areas are intertwined in such a manner that they help in holistic development of a student and also facilitate geographic mobility, a boon for people on the move. The curriculum is designed and developed to support the vision and mission of the school. Through individualized education, we foster academic excellence and cultivate self-confident, creative, reflective, and analytical thinkers. The curriculum is a unique blend of emerging trends in education with tried and tested methodologies and best practices put into use.The academic year begins in April and ends in March. It comprises of two terms for the Primary and the Middle school, and three terms for the Secondary school. The school follows the CCE (continuous comprehensive assessment). The assessments are broadly classified as SA (summative assessment) and FA (Formative assessment). There are two FA's per term and the end of the term is concluded by a SA. As part of the curriculum reform, the school has student-centered and problem-based learning to stimulate active learning among students. Web-based instructions and on-line information sources are used to enhance students' active learning, while teachers act as mentors and guides in the process.

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As part of the school environment, a canteen is in a unique position to make a positive contribution to students’ health and welfare. The functions of school canteens are to:

provide a service to the school community.
provide a variety of nutritious and attractively presented food and drinks at a reasonable cost and reinforce  classroom learning.

<h5>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h5>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 implement">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.

Student attendance software is designed to record & manage daily student attendance in schools to speed up the daily attendance process & reduce manual work. It is used to track student's attendence, absentee record, attendance history & other related documents.
